## 🔑 Core Pillars

### The Trinity
- **Agents** - Cognitive processing (stateful, reasoning)
- **Tools** - Deterministic execution (stateless, MCP-compliant)
- **Services** - Infrastructure (singleton, containerized)

### The Pantheon (Titan-Class Agents)
- **ClaudeTitan** - Strategic synthesis
- **GPTTitan** - Creative vision
- **GeminiTitan** - Technical analysis
- **GrokTitan** - Chaos engineering

### The Three Layers
- **L1: Governance** - Attribution, compliance, audit
- **L2: Orchestration** - Routing, planning, coordination
- **L3: Execution** - Agents, tools, services
