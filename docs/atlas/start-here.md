## 💡 Key Insights

**Whiteboard Protocol**: State-based collaboration (not transcript-based) with strict turn-taking and timeboxed responses. Moderator is sole writer of whiteboard state.

**Physics-Based Memory**: Memory retrieval governed by six attraction forces creating emergent routing. High-mass memories form persistent gravity wells.

**CollaboratorMixin**: Genetic implant enabling swarm intelligence with decentralized task selection and concurrent processing.
