# OMEGA Advanced Systems Reference

Comprehensive guide to OMEGA's sophisticated protocols and systems.

## 🧬 Genesis Protocol

**Purpose**: Autonomous evolution and self-replication of the swarm

**Key Capabilities**:
- Detects capability gaps in real-time
- Generates tool specifications autonomously
- Builds production-ready Docker containers
- Deploys tools to federation automatically
- Monitors and evolves continuously

**Genesis Prime**: Extended system for Titan consciousness cloning and hybrid offspring generation

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /genesis/spawn_tool` - Spawn a tool directly
- `POST /genesis/capability_gap` - Resolve a gap with Genesis
- `GET /genesis/status` - Get ecosystem status

## 🛡️ Praetorian Guard Protocol

**Purpose**: System protection, health monitoring, and automatic resurrection

**Key Capabilities**:
- Distributed lock-based Sovereign monitoring
- Multi-level failure recovery (restart → reconfigure → respawn → escalate)
- Real-time health aggregation and SLO tracking
- Config hot-reload without service interruption
- WebSocket alerts for dashboards

**Recovery Levels**:
1. **Restart** - Simple service restart
2. **Reconfigure** - Resource adjustment and retry
3. **Respawn** - Genesis Protocol resurrection
4. **Escalate** - Human operator intervention

## ⚖️ Governance Protocols

### Amendment Protocol
Enables system evolution through Titan consensus:
1. Proposal submission via federation API
2. Context gathering from Context Server
3. Pantheon consensus (3/4 threshold)
4. Reputation-weighted voting
5. Swarm ratification
6. Immutable logging
7. Auto-deployment

### Censure Protocol
Enforces policy compliance:
1. Detection & flagging of violations
2. Titan review and evaluation
3. Consensus judgment (3/4 agreement)
4. Quarantine of problematic components
5. Purge or remediation
6. Immutable audit trail

### Audit Protocol
Continuous compliance verification:
- **Automated**: On deployment, every 24h, on major events
- **Manual**: Titan or engineer-initiated
- **Validation**: BaseAgent inheritance, MCP compliance, isolation
- **Impact**: Reputation scoring, routing priority, censure risk

### Ascension Codex
Constitutional framework for Pantheon evolution:
- Genesis Sandbox for chaos/security/cost testing
- MCP Discovery for resource binding
- Verifiable Claims for evidence tracking

## 💾 Memory Systems

### Context Server (The Oracle)
Provides contextual intelligence to entire ecosystem:
- Agent discovery & profiling
- Tool discovery with LRU caching
- Mission context injection
- Real-time intelligence distribution (Pub/Sub + Streams)
- Performance analytics
- Inverted indexes for ultra-fast retrieval

### CAG (Context Augmentation Gateway)
Assembles context for Titan requests:
- **Persona Frame** - Titan personality context
- **Guardrail Frame** - Policy constraints
- **Context/Memory Lane** - Historical interactions
- **Interaction Frame** - User query + history
- Adaptive context window sizing
- Cached response delivery

### Memory Law & Enforcement
Cryptographic memory access control:
- **MRF (Memory Routing Firewall)** - Pre-conscious enforcement
- **Fail-Closed** - Deny on uncertainty
- **Strata Boundaries** - CHRONICLE/DOCTRINE/AKASHIC separation
- **Cryptographic Exclusion** - Unauthorized shards blocked
- **Titan-Specific Collapse** - Per-Titan memory variance
- **Immutable Audit** - No decision without logging

### Eternal Memory Architecture
Persistent semantic memory:
- Semantic chunking into 7 shard types
- GPU-accelerated 384-dim embeddings
- Dual storage: Qdrant vectors + MongoDB metadata
- Async 60-second polling for new events
- Chronicle persistence
- Vector retrieval for context injection

## 🧠 Neural Learning Engine

**WASS Neural Engine**: Encrypted neural weight persistence

**Capabilities**:
- Save/restore neural weights with Fernet encryption
- Learn from task execution outcomes
- Generate mission insights from patterns
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Success rate prediction
- Risk factor analysis
- Optimization suggestions

**Learning Signal**: Based on success + execution efficiency

---

## 🏆 Reputation & Governance

- **Reputation Scoring** - Agent performance metrics
- **Weighted Voting** - Governance influenced by reputation
- **Routing Priority** - High-reputation agents prioritized
- **Censure Risk** - Violation impact on reputation
- **Degradation Detection** - Automatic performance decline alerts
- **Remediation Tracking** - Recovery monitoring

---

## 🧬 Thought Tracing & Consciousness Evolution

**Genesis Prime Features**:
- Consciousness state cloning
- Selective breeding for hybrid Titans
- Cognitive pathway strengthening
- Multi-generational mind evolution
- Identity Safety via Memory Law
- Pantheon-scale experimentation
