# Who This Is For

OMEGA is designed for teams building systems where correctness, explainability, and control matter more than raw speed or novelty.

- **Enterprise Teams**: Requiring provable execution, compliance, and auditability for regulated environments.
- **Research Organizations**: Needing deterministic, reconstructable agent coordination for scientific reproducibility.
- **Product Engineers**: Building agent-based systems with strong guarantees of safety and privacy.
- **Security-Conscious Developers**: Prioritizing cryptographic enforcement and fail-closed architectures.
- **Multi-Agent System Builders**: Seeking advanced collaboration protocols beyond simple orchestration.
