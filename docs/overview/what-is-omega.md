# What OMEGA Is

OMEGA is a governed execution platform that coordinates AI agents with provable, reconstructable, and constrained execution.

- **Governed Execution**: Cryptographic enforcement of policies, schemas, and boundaries for safe agent coordination.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Whiteboard protocol with disciplined turn-taking, debate mechanics, and real-time moderation.
- **Physics-Based Memory**: Six-force attraction model creating emergent memory routing and persistent gravity wells.
- **Deterministic Receipts**: Proof-of-execution without exposing sensitive content, enabling auditability and replayability.
- **Modular Architecture**: Agents, engines, and substrates designed for incremental adoption and federation.
