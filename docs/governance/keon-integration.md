- **Policy Enforcement**: Smart contracts that enforce OMEGA's governance protocols at the blockchain level.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community voting and amendment ratification through distributed consensus.
- **Compliance Proofs**: Verifiable evidence of regulatory compliance for enterprise deployments.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration with OMEGA's receipts and fortress security architecture.
