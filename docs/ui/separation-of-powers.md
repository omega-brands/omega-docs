# Separation of Powers in Governed Systems

## Why This Exists

Most agent systems collapse execution and governance into a single interface.
This creates ambiguity, bypass risk, and unverifiable outcomes.

Keon and OMEGA enforce separation of powers at the UI level to prevent this.

## The Two Surfaces

| Surface        | Purpose                     | Authority |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Workshop      | Propose & observe execution | None      |
| Courtroom     | Decide & prove outcomes     | Human     |

Both sit beneath the kernel, which owns truth and enforcement.

## What Breaks If You Merge Them

- Decisions become mutable
- Evidence becomes disputable
- Accountability becomes ambiguous
- Audits become narratives instead of proofs

This is not a UX preference.
It is a governance requirement.

## The Kernel's Role

The kernel:
- validates policy
- enforces gates
- records receipts
- seals evidence

UIs are consumers — never authors — of truth.

## Design Principle

> **If a system can act and justify itself from the same surface, it is not governed.**

Separation of powers must remain visible, structural, and unavoidable.
