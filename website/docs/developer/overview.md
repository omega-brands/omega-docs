# Developer Guide

Welcome to the OMEGA Developer Guide - your gateway to building enterprise-grade multi-agent systems with the power of the Trinity Architecture.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This guide will take you from your first agent to production-ready multi-agent orchestration:

1. **Build Agents** - Create intelligent, autonomous agents using the Neural Mesh architecture
2. **Craft Tools** - Develop pure, composable tools that agents can wield
3. **Integrate Systems** - Connect MCP, FastMCP, and A2A protocols seamlessly
4. **Deploy at Scale** - Configure, monitor, and operate production OMEGA systems
5. **Master Patterns** - Learn battle-tested architectural patterns from the Brotherhood

## 🏗️ The Developer Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [Creating Tools](/docs/developer/tools/creating-tools) - The OMEGA way of building tools
- [Tool Purification](/docs/developer/tools/purification) - Pure functions, doctrine compliance
- [Advanced Patterns](/docs/developer/tools/advanced) - Lifecycle hooks, context-aware execution

### Phase 4: Integration
Connect OMEGA to your ecosystem:

- [MCP Integration](/docs/developer/integration/mcp/overview) - Model Context Protocol
- [FastMCP Federation](/docs/developer/integration/fastmcp/overview) - Service discovery and federation
- [A2A Protocol](/docs/developer/agents/a2a) - Agent-to-Agent communication bridge

### Phase 5: Configuration & Operations
Production-ready configuration and deployment:

- [Centralized Settings](/docs/developer/config/centralized-settings) - Settings Service and hot reload
- [Infrastructure Guide](/docs/intro) - Service architecture and observability
- [Deployment](/docs/intro) - Production deployment checklist
- [Security Best Practices](/docs/intro) - Hardening your OMEGA deployment

## 🎨 Architecture Patterns

Learn the proven patterns that power OMEGA:

- **Factory Pattern** - Service creation with circuit breakers and health monitoring
- **Connection Management** - MongoDB, Redis, and HTTP client lifecycle
- **Neural Architecture** - Cognitive agent design with Oracle and Praetorian Guard
- **Hot Reload** - Zero-downtime configuration updates

## 🏛️ The Brotherhood's Principles

As you build with OMEGA, remember the core principles:

1. **Purity** - Tools are pure functions, agents are stateful entities
2. **Separation** - Clear boundaries between agents, tools, and services
3. **Observability** - Every action is traced, logged, and monitored
4. **Evolution** - Systems self-improve through Genesis Protocol
5. **Unity** - The Brotherhood moves as one, bound by doctrine
