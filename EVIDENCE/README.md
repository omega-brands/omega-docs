# Keon Evidence Vault

⚠️ **Write-once. Read-only. Verifiable.**  

This repository is the **append-only evidence vault** for Keon-governed workflows.  
It stores sealed evidence packs, receipts, and verification artifacts that prove
*what happened*, *under which policy*, and *under whose authority*.

**Execution proposes. Governance decides. Receipts prove.**

See [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) for permitted and prohibited use.

## What Is an Evidence Vault?

An **evidence vault** is a repository designed to store **sealed, immutable proof**
of governed system behavior.

In Keon, evidence vaults exist to ensure that:
- outcomes can be independently verified
- decisions are attributable to explicit human authority
- system behavior can be audited without trust in narratives or logs

**Evidence stands on its own. Verification is the source of truth.**

This repository is intentionally **append-only**. Existing artifacts must never be
modified or replaced. New runs produce new evidence.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains:
- Sealed evidence packs (`sealed.zip`)
- Deterministic receipts (`receipts.jsonl`)
- Human decision records (`directive_receipts.json`)
- Policy versions applied during execution
- Integrity manifests and cryptographic hashes

These artifacts are generated by **policy-driven, Keon-governed workflows**.

Git history is **not** the authority.  
Cryptographic verification is.

## What This Repository Is Not

- ❌ Not source code
- ❌ Not documentation meant for reuse or modification
- ❌ Not an open-source library
- ❌ Not a narrative record or marketing artifact

No file here is accidental.  
No artifact here is mutable.

- Each workflow run lives in its own directory
- Corrections result in **new runs**, not edits
- Meaning follows placement. Placement follows governance.

## The Evidence Ledger (VAULT_LEDGER.jsonl)

`VAULT_LEDGER.jsonl` is an **append-only index** of all evidence packs stored here.

Each entry records:
- timestamp of sealing
- workflow ID and run ID
- source repository and commit SHA
- policy ID, version, and hash
- sealed archive hash
- manifest hash

The ledger enables:
- quick discovery of evidence
- independent verification
- external audit without repo traversal

The ledger itself is not authoritative — it is a **map**.  
The sealed evidence packs are the authority.

## How to Verify an Evidence Pack

Verification is intentionally simple and tool-agnostic.

### 1. Locate the Evidence Pack
Each run directory contains:
- `sealed.zip`
- `seal-manifest.json`

---

### 2. Verify the Sealed Archive

```bash
sha256sum sealed.zip
```

Compare the result to the hash recorded in seal-manifest.json.

They must match exactly.

### 3. Verify Individual Artifacts (Optional)

```bash
unzip sealed.zip
sha256sum <filename>
```

Confirm hashes match those recorded in the manifest.

### 4. Review Receipts and Decisions

- receipts.jsonl — deterministic workflow receipts
- directive_receipts.json — explicit human authority
- file_decisions.jsonl — derived actions under approved directives
- Human authority is explicit, non-delegable, and receipted.
- No silent changes. No implicit approval.

## Immutability Guarantees

This repository is enforced as write-once, read-many.

- Existing evidence must not be modified or deleted
- Only new directories may be added
- History rewriting is blocked by policy and repository protections
- Any modification invalidates integrity guarantees.

---

## Referenced By

Evidence in this vault is referenced by:

- Keon documentation (keon-docs, keon-docs-internal)
- OMEGA workflows (omega-docs, omega-docs-internal)
- Governed remediation and categorization workflows
- Repositories reference evidence by hash and path, not by trust.

---

## Why This Exists

Most systems ask you to trust logs, dashboards, or explanations.

Keon systems provide evidence instead.

Sealed. Deterministic. Auditable.

Evidence stands on its own.
