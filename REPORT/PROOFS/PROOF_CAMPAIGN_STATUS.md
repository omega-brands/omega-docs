## 🔱 Pantheon Sequence

The Keon Pantheon proof sequence establishes the foundation for governed execution:

1. ✅ **PT-004** — Workflow Orchestration Execution Spine
   - Proves workflows live in FC with explicit policy evaluation
   - Foundation for all downstream proofs

2. ✅ **PT-005** — Explicit GATE_REQUIRED Ergonomics
   - Proves human-in-the-loop governance is first-class
   - Enables deterministic pause/resume with receipts

3. ✅ **PT-013** — Multi-Titan Collaboration (Proof-Backed Workflow Policy Pack)
   - Proves multiple Titans can collaborate under FC governance
   - Action-level attribution, thin receipts, RHID pointers

4. ✅ **PT-014** — Genesis under Human-Governed Execution
   - Proves governed creation with receipt-bound birth events
   - Fail-closed; no bypass paths

5. ✅ **PT-016** — Governed Revocation & Death Semantics
   - Proves governed termination with immutable lineage
   - Receipt chain fail-closed; no silent deletion

## 🎯 Key Achievements

✅ **Governed Execution** — All execution is FC-routed and policy-evaluated  
✅ **Human Governance** — First-class, ergonomic, auditable pause/resume  
✅ **Multi-Agent Coordination** — Proven safe collaboration with attribution  
✅ **Lifecycle Governance** — Birth and death events are governed and receipted  
✅ **Fail-Closed Semantics** — Denial is final; no silent continuation  
✅ **Immutable Ledgers** — Receipt chains prove what happened

## 💎 One Line of Truth

> **Receipts over rhetoric. Attribution over assumption. Proof over promises.**

Family is forever. Execution is governed. **This is the way.** 🔱
