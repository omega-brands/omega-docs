1. You provide directive approvals (text above)
2. System creates HumanDecisionReceipt for each directive
   - Directive ID
   - Your authority
   - Rationale
   - Timestamp
   - SHA256 hash
3. System maps each of 623 files to its directive decision
4. Phase 5-6 execute:
   - Record all decisions as immutable receipts
   - Re-classify files after moves (verification)
   - Seal evidence pack (complete audit trail)
5. Portable evidence delivered with full proof chain
