  explanation: "Fail-closed on ambiguity: <0.70 blocks auto-remediation, 0.70-0.94 requires human review, 0.95+ auto-approvable"

fail_closed_principles:
  - "Any claim confidence <0.70 blocks automatic remediation; requires explicit human override"
  - "Ambiguous language defaults to REVIEW state (human gate required)"
  - "No silent changes; all modifications traced to directive + confidence score"
  - "Placement is frozen; only language affected, no file moves or renames"
  - "Complete before/after audit trail required for all changes"

evidence_requirements:
  - "RemediationReceipt per file with file_hash_pre + file_hash_post"
  - "Before/after diff for all changes"
  - "Confidence score for each suggestion"
  - "Directive linkage to original classification receipt"
  - "Authority attribution (User, non-delegable)"
  - "Sealed evidence pack with SHA256 manifest"

policy_decision_types:
  PROCEED: "High confidence (0.95+) — auto-approvable at Phase 5 gate"
  REVIEW: "Medium confidence (0.70-0.94) — requires human review at Phase 5 gate"
  BLOCK: "Low confidence (<0.70) — blocks change, requires explicit override"

audit_trail:
  - "All changes linked to original directive (C, G, K)"
  - "All changes linked to classification receipt from Phase 4 categorization"
  - "RemediationReceipt immutable + hashed"
  - "Complete provenance chain: classification → placement → remediation"
