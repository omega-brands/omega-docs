KEY FINDINGS BY CATEGORY
================================================================================

1. GOVERNANCE DEFINITIONS IN WRONG REPO
   Files: 419 (53% of mitigations)
   Current: omega-docs (public)
   Issue: Governance definitions should not be in public OMEGA repos
   Target: keon-docs-internal (370) or keon-docs (57)
   Examples:
     - EXECUTION_READY_SUMMARY.md
     - KEON_REMEDIATION_INDEX.md
     - RUNBOOK_REMEDIATION_CYCLE_1.md
     - docs/atlas/keon/** (governance docs)
     - docs/atlas/ppp/** (kernel docs)

2. TECHNICAL DOCS IN WRONG REPO
   Files: 105 (17% of mitigations)
   Current: omega-docs-internal (internal)
   Issue: Technical/descriptive docs should be in public omega-docs
   Target: omega-docs
   Examples:
     - bootstrap.md
     - BrandGenie-OMEGA-Integration.md
     - dual_mode_agent_readme.md
     - docs/** (98 technical docs)

3. GUARANTEE CLAIMS WITHOUT EVIDENCE
   Files: 84 (13% of mitigations)
   Current: omega-docs (public)
   Issue: Public documents with guarantee claims need evidence pack
   Target: omega-docs-internal (move) OR keep + add evidence
   Examples:
     - README.md
     - docs/landing.md
     - docs/atlas/documentation-complete.md
     - docs/atlas/capabilities-index.md
   Action: Move to internal OR add evidence pack

4. MISPLACED GOVERNANCE IN KEON REPOS
   Files: 12 (2% of mitigations)
   Current: Wrong Keon repo
   Issue: Draft governance in keon-docs; some content in omega-docs-internal
   Target: keon-docs-internal (if draft) or keon-docs (if published)

5. DRAFT CONTENT IN PUBLIC REPOS (DENIED BY POLICY)
   Files: 2 (BLOCKED - cannot move without override)
   Current: keon-docs, omega-docs-internal
   Issue: Draft/experimental content violates fail-closed policy
   Blocked: keon-docs/whitepaper/WHITEPAPER.md
            omega-docs-internal/doctrine/CONVERSATIONAL_PANTHEON_ARCHITECTURE.md
   Action: DECIDE what to do (move to internal, publish, or remove)

================================================================================
TARGET REPO DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

Where documents want to move:
  keon-docs-internal: 370 files (59% of moves)
  keon-docs:         145 files (23% of moves)
  omega-docs:        105 files (17% of moves)
  omega-docs-internal: 1 file (0.2% of moves)

================================================================================
NEXT STEP: PROVIDE DECISIONS
================================================================================

You must decide for 621 MITIGATE findings what to do.

Decision Format (JSON):
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "document_id": "omega-docs/EXECUTION_READY_SUMMARY.md",
      "decision_type": "ACCEPT|MODIFY|REJECT",
      "authority": "Your Name",
      "rationale": "Why this decision"
    }
  ]
}

Decision Types:
  ACCEPT  - Approve the suggested target repo
  MODIFY  - Different target or different action
  REJECT  - Keep document where it is (requires rationale)

Options to Provide Decisions:
  1. All at once (621 decisions)
  2. By batch (categories)
  3. Auto-accept with manual exceptions
  4. Conversational (one at a time or by discussion)

Immutability Note:
  Once recorded, ALL decisions become immutable audit trail.
  This is intentional for governance accountability.

================================================================================
GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES
================================================================================

What Cannot Happen:
  - Silent moves (every decision must be explicit)
  - Unapproved changes (only accepted moves apply)
  - Policy violations (2 DENY findings blocked)
  - Unrationalized moves (rationale required)
  - Unsigned decisions (authority required)

What Is Guaranteed:
  - Every decision receipted (immutable record)
  - Every receipt hashed (deterministic)
  - Every authority named (accountability)
  - Every move verified (re-classification proof)
  - Everything sealed (portable & auditable)

================================================================================
PHASE 5-6 EXECUTION (After Decisions)
================================================================================

Phase 5: Record Decisions
  - Each decision becomes immutable HumanDecisionReceipt
  - Policy validates each decision
  - All decisions hashed and timestamped

Phase 6: Seal Evidence Pack
  - Bundle all 763 classification receipts
  - Bundle all 621 decision receipts
  - Create batch summary (your authority)
  - Generate seal manifest (SHA256 hashes)
  - Zip and seal final archive

Output: Complete audit trail with proof of human accountability
